"""32-bit host process for Eloquence synthesis.

This module is executed as a separate helper process under a 32-bit Python
runtime.  It exposes a simple RPC protocol over a length-prefixed pickle IPC
channel so that 64-bit NVDA builds can continue to make use of the original
synthesizer.

The engine itself lives in ``_eci_engine``, which is shared verbatim with the
Synth Driver side so the two backends cannot drift apart.  PyInstaller freezes a
copy of it into this executable (see the ``--paths`` flag in build_host.cmd), so
nothing here depends on the add-on being importable at run time.  What remains
in this module is only what is genuinely process-shaped: the Host Channel, the
command dispatch and the log file.

The helper deliberately avoids importing NVDA modules to keep the runtime self
contained.  All configuration required to load the DLL, open dictionaries and
select the initial voice is provided by the controller process as part of the
`initialize` command.
