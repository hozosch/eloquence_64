"""Windows Job Object backstop that kills the Eloquence Host Process with NVDA.

The Synth Driver side asks the Eloquence Host Process to exit over the Host
Channel on ``terminate()``, and that cooperative path is the one that matters:
a onefile PyInstaller build only removes its ``_MEI`` temp directory when it
exits on its own.

The handshake cannot run when NVDA never gets the chance to send it.  A crash,
a ``taskkill /f``, or an Eloquence Engine call that never returns all leave the
Eloquence Host Process orphaned, holding an Eloquence Engine handle and often
the output device, until someone notices it in Task Manager.

A Job Object created with ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` closes that gap
without the Eloquence Host Process cooperating.  The Synth Driver side holds the
only handle to the job, so when the NVDA process goes away for any reason the
kernel closes that handle and terminates every process still in the job.

This is strictly a backstop.  It is never used to shut the Eloquence Host Process
down normally, because a job kill is ``TerminateProcess`` and leaves the ``_MEI``
directory behind - exactly what the cooperative path exists to avoid.  Every
failure here is logged and ignored: a missing backstop must never stop Eloquence
speaking.
