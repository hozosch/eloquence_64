"""Shared ctypes wrapper around an ECI-compatible Eloquence Engine.

This module is imported by two different processes with two different bitnesses:

* The Eloquence Host Process (32-bit, frozen by PyInstaller) uses it to drive the
  proprietary 32-bit ``ECI.DLL``, and forwards engine events over the Host
  Channel.
* The Synth Driver side (64-bit, in NVDA's own process) uses it to drive
  openevv's 64-bit ``eci.dll`` directly, with no host process and no IPC.

Two rules keep that dual use working, and both are asserted by the test suite
rather than left to convention:

* **No NVDA imports.** The Eloquence Host Process must stay self contained.
* **No relative imports.** The Synth Driver side imports this as
  ``from . import _eci_engine``; the frozen host imports it as a top-level
  ``import _eci_engine``. A relative import would only resolve on one side.

The engine reports audio and Speech Indexes through a *sink* supplied by the
caller instead of writing to a transport itself, which is what lets the same
code serve both a Host Channel and an in-process audio queue.
