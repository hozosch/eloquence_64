"""Download the engine binaries the build needs but source control excludes.

Two engines, fetched for different reasons:

* The proprietary Eloquence Engine (``ECI.DLL`` + the western ``.SYN`` voice
  data) is IBM proprietary, and comes from the same upstream release artifact
  the old build system used.  This is what the Eloquence Host Process loads.
* openevv's 64-bit ``eci.dll`` is an MIT-licensed reimplementation exporting the
  same ECI names, which 64-bit NVDA can load in its own process.  Its newest
  release is resolved at build time, so a rebuild picks up a new openevv without
  any change here.  Note that openevv's own NOTICE excludes its ``lang/enus``
  data from that MIT grant, so this binary is treated like the proprietary files
  and kept out of source control too.

Usage:
    python fetch_eci.py                # downloads whatever is missing
    python fetch_eci.py --force        # re-downloads even if files exist
    python fetch_eci.py --openevv-only # skip the proprietary files
    python fetch_eci.py --no-openevv   # skip openevv
